abstract = {While big data analytics is considered as one of the most important paths to competitive advantage of today's enterprises, data scientists spend a comparatively large amount of time in the data preparation and data integration phase of a big data project. This shows that data integration is still a major challenge in IT applications. Over the past two decades, the idea of using semantics for data integration has become increasingly crucial, and has received much attention in the AI, database, web, and data mining communities. Here, we focus on a specific paradigm for semantic data integration, called Ontology-Based Data Access (OBDA). The goal of this paper is to provide an overview of OBDA, pointing out both the techniques that are at the basis of the paradigm, and the main challenges that remain to be addressed.},

abstract = {Public transportation schedules are designed by agencies to optimize service quality under multiple constraints. However, real service usually deviates from the plan. Therefore, transportation analysts need to identify, compare and explain both eventual and systemic performance issues that must be addressed so that better timetables can be created. The purely statistical tools commonly used by analysts pose many difficulties due to the large number of attributes at trip- and station-level for planned and real service. Also challenging is the need for models at multiple scales to Search for patterns at different times and stations, since analysts do not know exactly where or when relevant patterns might emerge and need to compute statistical summaries for multiple attributes at different granularities. To aid in this analysis, we worked in close collaboration with a transportation expert to design TR-EX, a visual exploration tool developed to identify, inspect and compare spatio-temporal patterns for planned and real transportation service. TR-EX combines two new visual encodings inspired by Marey's Train Schedule: Trips Explorer for trip-level analysis of frequency, deviation and speed; and Stops Explorer for station-level study of delay, wait time, reliability and performance deficiencies such as bunching. To tackle overplotting and to provide a robust representation for a large numbers of trips and stops at multiple scales, the system supports variable kernel bandwidths to achieve the level of detail required by users for different tasks. We justify our design decisions based on specific analysis needs of transportation analysts. We provide anecdotal evidence of the efficacy of TR-EX through a series of case studies that explore NYC subway service, which illustrate how TR-EX can be used to confirm hypotheses and derive new insights through visual exploration.},

abstract = {Using Beijing as an example, this research demonstrates that smartcard data can be used to (a) assemble the required data for excess commuting studies, and (b) visualise related results. Based on both smartcard and household travel survey data, we find that the theoretical minimum commute is considerably lower for bus users than for car users in Beijing. This suggests that there is a greater inter-mixing of jobs-housing functions (i.e., a better jobs-housing balance) associated with users of that mode compared to the corresponding land-use arrangement for car users, who locate further from the central area (Tian'anmen) than bus users. The commuting range for car users is 9.4. km greater than for bus users. Excess commuting is slightly higher for bus users (69.5{\%}) than for car users (68.8{\%}). Commuting capacity values are slightly lower for car users than for bus users, implying that car users consume less of their available commuting resources overall than bus users, albeit only marginally.},

AVL records for 24,451 tram vehicle trips in March 2001 and 26,155 trips in March 2004 were analyzed for 175 tram stops. Arrival travel times and differences between scheduled and actual arrival times were computed for each stop.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Authors. This paper proposes an ontology-based approach to support the process of visualizing urban mobility data. The approach consists of building a visualization-oriented urban mobility ontology, focused on themes such as ridership, vehicle flows and the like. Existing ontologies focus on modelling the overall structure of transportation networks, and do not address the formalization of such themes. The ontology also allows characterizing visualization techniques with human perception factors, so that they can be used to automatically infer recommended techniques for a dataset. The ultimate goal is to benefit decision makers, by providing an ontology that can assist with the process of developing semantically-rich visualizations, with increased data interoperability and knowledge extraction capabilities. We provide an example with real data of the public transportation system of the city of Porto, Portugal. The example shows the semantic characterization of a visualization technique, and how semantics can assist the task of automatically recommending visualizations.},

abstract = {Transport assessment plays a vital role in urban planning and traffic control, which are influenced by multi-faceted traffic factors involving road infrastructure and traffic flow. Conventional solutions can hardly meet the requirements and expectations of domain experts. In this paper we present a data-driven solution by leveraging a visual analysis system to evaluate the real traffic situations based on taxi trajectory data. A sketch-based visual interface is designed to support dynamic query and visual reasoning of traffic situations within multiple coordinated views. In particular, we propose a novel road-based query model for analysts to interactively conduct evaluation tasks. This model is supported by a bi-directional hash structure, TripHash, which enables real-time responses to the data queries over a huge amount of trajectory data. Case studies with a real taxi GPS trajectory dataset ({\textgreater} 30GB) show that our system performs well for on-demand transport assessment and reasoning.},

abstract = {Over the past two decades, smart card data have received increasing interest from transport researchers as a new source of data for travel behaviour investigation. Collected by smart card systems, smart card data surpass traditional travel survey data in providing more comprehensive spatial–temporal information about urban public transport-based (UPT) trips. However, the utility of smart card data has arguably yet to be exploited fully in terms of extracting and exploring the spatial–temporal dynamics of UPT passenger travel behaviour. To advance previous work in this area, this paper demonstrates a multi-step methodology in order to render more insightful spatial–temporal patterns of UPT passenger travel behaviour. Drawing on the Brisbane, Australia, bus network as the case study, a smart card dataset was first processed in combination with General Transit Specification Feed (GTFS) data to reconstruct travel trajectories of bus passengers at bus stop level of spatial granularity. By applying geographical information system-based (GIS) techniques, this dataset was used to create flow-comaps to visualise the aggregate flow patterns at a network level. The flow-comaps uncovered the major pathways of bus passengers and its variations over a one-day period. The differences within the flow-comaps were also quantified to produce weighted flow-comaps that highlighted the major temporal changes of passenger flow patterns along a number of stop-to-stop linkages of the bus network. The proposed methodology visually unveiled the spatial–temporal travel behaviour dynamics of UPT passengers and, in doing so, showed the potential to contribute to a new evidence base with the capacity to inform local public transport policy.},

abstract = {The 3DTown project is focused on the development of a distributed system for sensing, interpreting and visualizing the real-time dynamics of urban life within the 3D context of a city. At the heart of this technology lies a core of algorithms that automatically integrate 3D urban models with data from pan/tilt video cameras, environmental sensors and other real-time information sources. A key challenge is the "three-dimensionalization" of pedestrians and vehicles tracked in 2D camera video, which requires automatic real-time computation of camera pose relative to the 3D urban environment. In this paper we report preliminary results from a prototype system we call 3DTown, which is composed of discrete modules connected through pre-determined communication protocols. Currently, these modules consist of: 1) A 3D modeling module that allows for the efficient reconstruction of building models and integration with indoor architectural plans, 2) A GeoWeb server that indexes a 3D urban database to render perspective views of both outdoor and indoor environments from any requested vantage, 3) Sensor modules that receive and distribute real-time data, 4) Tracking modules that detect and track pedestrians and vehicles in urban spaces and access highways, 5) Camera pose modules that automatically estimate camera pose relative to the urban environment, 6) Three-dimensionalization modules that receive information from the GeoWeb server, tracking and camera pose modules in order to back-project image tracks to geolocate pedestrians and vehicles within the 3D model, 7) An animation module that represents geo-located dynamic agents as sprites, and 8) A web-based visualization module that allows a user to explore the resulting dynamic 3D visualization in a number of interesting ways. To demonstrate our system we have used a blend of automatic and semi-automatic methods to construct a rich and accurate 3D model of a university campus, including both outdoor and indoor detail. The dem- nstration allows web-based 3D visualization of recorded patterns of pedestrian and vehicle traffic on streets and highways, estimations of vehicle speed, and real-time (live) visualization of pedestrian traffic and temperature data at a particular test site. Having demonstrated the system for hundreds of people, we report our informal observations on the user reaction, potential application areas and on the main challenges that must be addressed to bring the system closer to deployment.},

abstract = {With the widespread adoption of locationaware technology, obtaining long-sequence, massive and high-accuracy spatiotemporal trajectory data of individuals has become increasingly popular in various geographic studies. Trajectory data of taxis, one of the most widely used inner-city travel modes, contain rich information about both road network traffic and travel behavior of passengers. Such data can be used to study the microscopic activity patterns of individuals as well as the macro system of urban spatial structures. This paper focuses on trajectories obtained from GPS-enabled taxis and their applications for mining urban commuting patterns. A novel approach is proposed to discover spatiotemporal patterns of household travel from the taxi trajectory dataset with a large number of point locations. The approach involves three critical steps: spatial clustering of taxi origin-destination (OD) based on urban traffic grids to discover potentially meaningful places, identifying threshold values from statistics of the OD clusters to extract urban jobs-housing structures, and visualization of analytic results to understand the spatial distribution and temporal trends of the revealed urban structures and implied household commuting behavior. A case study with a taxi trajectory dataset in Shanghai, China is presented to demonstrate and evaluate the proposed method.},

abstract = {In the past three years, a number of attempts have been made to use Global Positioning System (GPS) devices to measure elements of person travel that have never been successfully measured by conventional interview and self-administered surveys. A key component of this application of GPS devices is to process the track points recorded, so as to produce maps and other visual representations of the travel conducted with the device. These maps and other visualisations of the travel are subsequently used in a prompted recall survey, to obtain additional data about the travel that cannot be measured by the GPS devices, such as travel purposes, number in the travelling party, and costs associated with the travel. Determining what constitutes a trip, and processing the data to produce a recognizable map of the travel is essential to the success of a prompted recall survey. In turn, the use of this type of survey avoids the need for survey subjects to enter data in a diary or electronic device during the travel-a task that is both burdensome and likely to be forgotten or omitted sufficiently often to negate most of the benefits of a GPS survey. This paper describes the use of the GPS devices in this type of survey, the paradigms used to convert the track points to coherent trips, examination and correction of the visualised travel, and methods used to prepare maps and other visual tools, which can be presented to subjects in a prompted recall survey. Methods to display the trips and other information that can be gained from alternative ways of presenting the data are also outlined in the paper. These include the ability to determine when a person travels in congested conditions, examination of delays at traffic lights and other controlled intersections, and identification of the locations of acceleration and deceleration episodes.},

Service design brings new service ideas to life through a human-centered and holistic design thinking approach. However, service design and innovation build on dispersed multidisciplinary contributions that are still poorly understood. The special issue that follows offers important contributions through the examination of service design and innovation literature, the links between service design and innovation, the role of customers in service design and innovation, and service design and innovation for well-being.

abstract = { Transportation data models traditionally are represented in Unified Modeling Language (UML). UML diagrams are intuitive for understanding transportation concepts and their relationships and thus provide standardized ways to construct transportation data models. Many UML models have been developed for this purpose. However, because UML does not consider semantics, sharing UML data is difficult. Reusing UML diagrams also is difficult. In contrast, web ontology language (OWL) describes the semantics of ontology and thus is good for knowledge sharing and reasoning. OWL data are easier to share and better for performing logical inference. Unfortunately, no automatic method is available to transform data models from UML to OWL. A method to automate the transformation process is presented, using transportation data as a case study. Results indicate that transportation data represented in OWL have many advantages, including facilitated data sharing and inference. They also indicate that although many elements in UML can be transformed to OWL, some do not have OWL counterparts. },

abstract = {Modern fare collection systems based on contactless cards and connected to central management systems increase the passenger comfort and reduce fraud but also open transportation systems to new opportunities in the "big data" era, enabling a better understanding and optimization of the infrastructure. Every magnetic or contactless card transaction contains information about when and where a passenger boarding happens. The use of this data to study transportation demand, detect passenger activity patterns and optimize networks accordingly was so far an exercise limited to the academic domain. In this study, we present an extension of ACS Atlas{\textregistered} fare collection systems allowing city planners, urban network operators and even users to easily understand the transportation demand of a city. The system takes the fare collection systems as input data source and processes it with suitable data mining and visualization techniques. We will present in this paper the use of the fare collection data in order to visualize demand in combination with GIS, its evolution over time, the characterization of geographical areas based on boarding patterns, the estimation of origin-destinations matrices and finally the estimation of vehicle load solely based on fare collection boarding events as provided by the fare collection systems.},

abstract = {Many transportation data sets are saturated with temporal information. Typical examples include data sets concerned with system monitoring, travel time, incident management, and many other temporally aligned features of intelligent transportation systems. Because time is a linear entity, transportation researchers typically plot their temporal data into visualizations that use techniques tailored to linear data sets, such as tables, line charts, and scatter plots. The patterns that temporal data exhibit over time are often more interesting than the linearity of the data, but conventional visualizations often fail to convey them effectively. The spiral graph is a data visualization technique that treats such patterns—and their deviations—as first-class citizens, by allowing for the efficient recognition of the regular cycles in the data. The spiral graph renders data along a temporal axis, which spirals outward at regular intervals. Individual data points are rendered as bands along the axis, creating visu...},

abstract = {Local departments of transportation and metropolitan planning organizations have been collecting traffic data for many decades. However, these data are rarely exploited to their full potential. In this paper, we describe an exploratory visualization toolkit for large traffic flow databases. The visualization toolkit is based on the concept of the traffic cube: an extension of the data cube in data mining. The traffic cube organizes traffic flow data across different spatial and temporal dimensions and with respect to user-specified aggregation levels. The toolkit allows the user to perform data cube operations to select, summarize and cross-tabulate the traffic data prior to visualization as two-dimensional space-time plots. We demonstrate a prototype system using MATLAB, ArcGIS and MS Access database software. Example visualizations of a large database of hourly traffic flows along major highways in the state of Utah (USA) over a 10-year period illustrate the potential for the toolkit to reveal patterns about traffic flows and trends hidden in the database.},

abstract = {Analyzing important changes to massive transportation datasets like national bottleneck statistics, passenger data for domestic flights, airline maintenance budgets, or even publication data from the Transportation Research Record can be extremely complex. These types of datasets are often grouped by attributes in a tree structure hierarchy. The parent-child relationships of these hierarchical datasets allow for unique analytical opportunities, including the ability to track changes in the dataset at different levels of granularity, over time or between versions. For example, analysts can use hierarchies to uncover changes in the patterns of passengers flying in the United States over the last ten years, breaking down the data by states, cities, airports, and number of passengers. Exploring changes in travel patterns over time can help carriers make better decisions regarding their operations and long-range planning.This paper describes TreeVersity2, a web-based data comparison tool that provides users with information visualization techniques to find what has changed in a dataset over time. TreeVersity2 enables users to explore data that can be inherently hierarchical or not (by categorizing them by their attributes). An interactive textual reporting tool complements the visual exploration when the amount of data is very large. The results of two case studies conducted with transportation domain experts along with the results of an exit questionnaire are also described. TreeVersity2 preloaded with several demo datasets can be found at (http://treeversity.cattlab.umd.edu) along with several example videos.},

Given the positions of each car at two recorded locations on a highway and the corresponding time instances, our approach can reconstruct the traffic flows (i.e., the dynamic motions of multiple cars over time) between the two locations along the highway for immersive visualization of virtual cities or other environments. Our algorithm is applicable to high-density traffic on highways with an arbitrary number of lanes and takes into account the geometric, kinematic, and dynamic constraints on the cars. Our method reconstructs the car motion that automatically minimizes the number of lane changes, respects safety distance to other cars, and computes the acceleration necessary to obtain a smooth traffic flow subject to the given constraints. Furthermore, our framework can process a continuous stream of input data in real time, enabling the users to view virtualized traffic events in a virtual world as they occur. We demonstrate our reconstruction technique with both synthetic and real-world input.},

Five-year crash data for Harris County (primarily the City of Houston), Texas are analyzed using a geographic information system (GIS), and spatial–temporal patterns of relative crash risks are identified based on a Bayesian approach. This approach is used to identify and rank roadway segments with potentially high risks for crashes so that preventive actions can be taken to reduce the risks in these segments. Results demonstrate the approach is useful in estimating the relative crash risks, eliminating the instability of estimates while maintaining overall safety trends. The 3-D posterior risk maps show risky roadway segments where safety improvements need to be implemented. Results of GIS-based Bayesian mapping are also useful for travelers to choose relatively safer routes.},

abstract = {Intra-urban human mobility is investigated by means of taxi trajectory data that are collected in Shanghai, China, where taxis play an important role in urban transportation. From the taxi trajectories, approximately 1.5 million trips of anonymous customers are extracted on seven consecutive days. The globally spatio-temporal patterns of trips exhibit a significant daily regularity. Since each trip can be viewed as a displacement in the random walk model, the distributions of the distance and direction of the extracted trips are investigated in this research. The direction distribution shows an NEE--SWW-dominant direction, and the distance distribution can be well fitted by an exponentially truncated power law, with the scaling exponent {\$}\beta{\$} = 1.2 {\{}$\backslash$textpm{\}} 0.15. The observed patterns are attributed to the geographical heterogeneity of the study area, which makes the spatial distribution of trajectory stops to be non-uniform. We thus construct a model that integrates both the geographical heterogeneity and distance decay effect, to interpret the observed patterns. Our Monte Carlo simulation results closely match to the observed patterns and thus validate the proposed modfile:///Users/thiagosobral/Downloads/intraurban.pdfel. According to the proposed model, in a single-core urban area, the geographical heterogeneity and distance decay effect improve each other when influencing human mobility patterns. Geographical heterogeneity leads to a faster observed decay, and the distance decay effect makes the spatial distribution of trips more concentrated.},

Several examples of maps designed as a navigational aid for Web resources are presented in this review with an emphasis on maps of medical and health-related resources. The latter include HealthCyberMap maps http://healthcybermap.semanticweb.org/ , which can be classified as conceptual information space maps, and the very abstract and geometric Visual Net maps of PubMed http://map.net (for demos). Information resources can be also organised and navigated based on their geographic attributes. Some of the maps presented in this review use a Kohonen Self-Organising Map algorithm, and only HealthCyberMap uses a Geographic Information System to classify Web resource data and render the maps. Maps based on familiar metaphors taken from users' everyday life are much easier to understand. Associative and pictorial map icons that enable instant recognition and comprehension are preferred to geometric ones and are key to successful maps for browsing medical/health Internet information resources.},

Past research has found that SVCs tend to cluster both spatially and temporally. However, limited research has been conducted to investigate the interaction between the location of SVCs and the time they occur, especially at different levels of scales or spatial extents. This paper applied spatial, temporal and spatio-temporal techniques to investigate patterns of SVCs in Western Australia between 1999 and 2008, at different levels of scale. Spider graphs were adapted to identify temporal patterns of vehicle crashes at two different levels of scales: daily and weekly with respect to their causes. The spatial structures of vehicle crashes were analysed using Kernel Density Estimation analysis at three different scales: West Australia, Metropolitan area, and Perth Local Government Area (LGA). These are illustrated using spatial zooming theory. Comap was then used to demonstrate the spatio-temporal interaction effect on vehicle crashes. The results show significant differences in spatio-temporal patterns of SVCs for various crash causes. The techniques used here have the potential to help decision makers in developing effective road safety strategies.},

abstract = {A spatially abstracted transportation network is a graph where nodes are territory compartments (areas in geographic space) and edges, or links, are abstract constructs, each link representing all possible paths between two neighboring areas. By applying visual analytics techniques to vehicle traffic data from different territories, we discovered that the traffic intensity (a.k.a. traffic flow or traffic flux) and the mean velocity are interrelated in a spatially abstracted transportation network in the same way as at the level of street segments. Moreover, these relationships are consistent across different levels of spatial abstraction of a physical transportation network. Graphical representations of the flux–velocity interdependencies for abstracted links have the same shape as the fundamental diagram of traffic flow through a physical street segment, which is known in transportation science. This key finding substantiates our approach to traffic analysis, forecasting, and simulation leveraging spatial abstraction. We propose a framework in which visual analytics supports three high-level tasks, assess, forecast, and develop options, in application to vehicle traffic. These tasks can be carried out in a coherent workflow, where each next task uses the results of the previous one(s). At the ‘assess' stage, vehicle trajectories are used to build a spatially abstracted transportation network and compute the traffic intensities and mean velocities on the abstracted links by time intervals. The interdependencies between the two characteristics of the links are extracted and represented by formal models, which enable the second step of the workflow, ‘forecast', involving simulation of vehicle movements under various conditions. The previously derived models allow not only prediction of normal traffic flows conforming to the regular daily and weekly patterns but also simulation of traffic in extraordinary cases, such as road closures, major public events, or mass evacuation due to a disaster. Interactive visual tools support preparation of simulations and analysis of their results. When the simulation forecasts problematic situations, such as major congestions and delays, the analyst proceeds to the step ‘develop options' for trying various actions aimed at situation improvement and investigating their consequences. Action execution can be imitated by interactively modifying the input of the simulation model. Specific techniques support comparisons between results of simulating different “what if” scenarios.},

abstract = {Vehicle detectors (VDs) are usually distributed in a road network to detect macroscopic traffic situations. These detectors provide global information such as vehicle flows, average speed, and road occupancy. Given that the collected statistic data are difficult for citizens to interpret, we visualize the data by providing users with realistic traffic videos. To achieve this aim, our system collects the surveillance videos and VD data that represent the traffic situation of a position. It then builds the connection between these two types of data. Considering the distribution of VDs is much denser than that of surveillance cameras, for those road segments with a VD but without a surveillance camera, one can utilize our system to synthesize videos for visually depicting the traffic situations over there. That is, we estimate vehicle flows from a video and apply the regression model to build the mapping between the flows and VD data. After that, given by a VD dataset, our system retrieves videos that match the VD data and seamlessly composes them to synthesize a traffic video. The evaluations and the experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of our system.},

abstract = {Nowadays is extremely important to monitor and analyze the urban environment and in particular the urban viabil- ity. The increasing availability of computational power, to- gether with more efficient simulation algorithm allows real timemodeling of even complex systems such as urban traffic. Information and simulation are at the basis of the decisional process for policy makers at global and local level. In this context, visualization tools are useful aids where the under- standing of a simulated phenomenon is quite difficult. In recent years, microscopic traffic simulations have become an increasingly active field of research in transport engineering. However the main challenge of these systems is related to the high 'learning curve' and to the complex interface of the analysis tools. Often these models are used by final users that have specific competences to evaluate the phenomena and take appropriate decision. However, often these tools lack in usability and visualization makes it difficult to ex- tract useful information. To face this problemit is important to develop a visual-analytic tool with easily readable results for users with different backgrounds, in order to catch the important information in short time. In this paper we present a highly interactive visual analyt- ics system that helps urban planners, decision makers and traffic analysts simulate and analyze the urban scenario re- lated to the urban viability. The design of the interface has not been based on traditional pull-down menus, panels or buttons that can take the user outside of the frame of the task. The interaction is ensured through direct actions with the 3d context in order to make the operations intuitive and easy to perform. In this way the user is cognitively focused during the problem solving. The user can interact with the 3d environment through graphical metaphors that reduce considerably the time needed to set the parameters for the simulation as well as the time needed to analyze the results. In this paper we focus on the design of the interface and on the visual analysis of the simulation model.},

In this work, based on taxi GPS data, we propose OD-Wheel, a novel visual design and associated analysis tool, to explore OD patterns. Once users define a region, all taxi trips starting from or ending to that region are selected and grouped into OD clusters. With a hybrid circular-linear visual design, OD-Wheel allows users to explore the dynamic patterns of each OD cluster, including the variation of traffic flow volume and traveling time. The proposed tool supports convenient interactions and allows users to compare and correlate the patterns between different OD clusters.

abstract = {Traffic incidents such as road accidents and vehicle breakdowns are a major source of travel uncertainty and delay, but the mechanism by which they cause heavy traffic is not fully understood. Traffic management controllers are tasked with routing repair and clean up crews to clear the incident and often have to do so under time pres- sure and with imperfect information. To aid their decision making and help them understand how past incidents affected traffic, we propose Traffic Origins, a simple method to visualize the impact road incidents have on congestion. Just before a traffic incident occurs, we mark the incident location with an expanding circle to uncover the underlying traffic flow map and when it ends, the cir- cle recedes. This not only directs attention to upcoming events, but also allows us to observe the impact traffic incidents have on vehi- cle flow in the immediate vicinity and the cascading effect multiple incidents can have on a road network. We illustrate this technique using road incident and traffic flow data from Singapore.},

abstract = {Information extraction using distributed sensors has been widely used to obtain information knowledge from various regions or areas. Vehicle traffic data extraction is one of the ways to gather information in order to get the traffic condition information. This research intends to predict and visualize the traffic conditions in a particular road region. Traffic data was obtained from Department of Transport UK. These data are collected using hundreds of sensors for 24 h. Thus, the size of data is very huge. In order to get the behavior of the traffic condition, we need to analyze the huge dataset which was obtained from the sensors. The uses of conventional data mining methods are not sufficient to use, due to the process of knowledge building that should store data temporary in the memory. The fact that data is continuously becoming larger over time, therefore we need to find a method that could automatically adapt to process data in the form of streams. We use method called FIMT-DD (Fast Incremental Model Trees-Drift Detection) to analyze and predict the very large traffic dataset. Based on the prediction system that we have developed, we also visualize the prediction of traffic flow condition within generated sensor point in the real map simulation.},

We identify each of these as {\&}{\#}x2018;channels{\&}{\#}x2019; {\&}{\#}x2013; evolving relationships between producers and consumers of visualization {\&}{\#}x2013; where traditional roles of the visualization expert and domain expert are blurred. In each case, we identify the different design decisions that were required to support each of these channels and the role played by the visualization process. Using chauffeured interaction with a flexible visual analytics system we demonstrate how insight was gained by policy makers into gendered spatio-temporal cycle behaviors, how this led to further insight into workplace commuting activity, group cycling behavior and explanations for street navigation choice. We demonstrate how this supported, and was supported by, the seemingly unrelated development of narrative-driven visualization via TEDx, of the creation and the setting of an art installation and the curating of digital and physical artefacts. We assert that existing models of visualization design, of tool/technique development and of insight generation do not adequately capture the richness of parallel engagement via these multiple channels of communication. We argue that developing multiple channels in parallel opens up opportunities for visualization design and analysis by building trust and authority and supporting creativity. This rich, non-sequential approach to visualization design is likely to foster serendipity, deepen insight and increase impact.},

abstract = {Massive amount of movement data, such as daily trips made by millions of passengers in a city, are widely available nowadays. They are a highly valuable means not only for unveiling human mobility patterns, but also for assisting transportation planning, in particular for metropolises around the world. In this paper, we focus on a novel aspect of visualizing and analyzing massive movement data, i.e., the interchange pattern, aiming at revealing passenger redistribution in a traffic network. We first formulate a new model of circos figure, namely the interchange circos diagram, to present interchange patterns at a junction node in a bundled fashion, and optimize the color assignments to respect the connections within and between junction nodes. Based on this, we develop a family of visual analysis techniques to help users interactively study interchange patterns in a spatiotemporal manner: 1) multi-spatial scales: from network junctions such as train stations to people flow across and between larger spatial areas; and 2) temporal changes of patterns from different times of the day. Our techniques have been applied to real movement data consisting of hundred thousands of trips, and we present also two case studies on how transportation experts worked with our interface. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Author(s) Computer Graphics Forum {\textcopyright} 2013 The Eurographics Association and Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

In recent years, methodological advances have been made in the estimation of origin?destination matrices from disaggregate fare transaction and vehicle location data. Unlike manual origin?destination surveys, these methods provide nearly complete spatial and temporal coverage at minimal marginal cost. Early models inferred destinations on the basis of the proximity of possible destinations to the next origin and disregarded the effect of waiting time, in-vehicle time, and the number of transfers on path choice. The research reported here formulated a dynamic programming model that inferred destinations of public transportation trips on the basis of a generalized disutility minimization objective. The model inferred paths and transfers on multileg journeys and worked on systems that served a mix of gated stations and ungated stops. The model is being used to infer destinations of public transportation trips in Boston, Massachusetts, and is producing better results than could be obtained with earlier models.},

The human brain is a super-computer for finding patterns in information. Our understanding of visual data and visual information is greatly enhanced or impeded by the way information is presented. It is essential that visual data be designed in such a way that key information and important patterns will stand out. It is only by understanding how perception works that the best visualizations can be created. Colin Ware outlines the key principles for a wide range of applications and designs, providing designers with the tools to create visualizations of improved clarity, utility and persuasiveness. The book continues to be the key resource for practical design guidelines, based on perception, which can be applied by practitioners, students and researchers alike.

abstract = {The rapid growth of urban population and numbers of private cars in this modern era, results in increasingly urgent transportation problem in cities throughout the world. Road traffic congestion is an omnipresent problem, which leads to delays, time loss, human stress, energy consumption, environmental pollution e.c.t. In order to decrease traffic congestion, there is a need for simulating and optimizing traffic control and improving traffic management. There are different ways for traffic congestion monitoring and analysis such as using video monitoring and surveillance systems, or static and dynamic sensors which allow traffic management in real time. There are also other methods using non real time analysis where traf?c congestion can be extracted from historical patterns of traf?c congestion. The historical patterns can be gained from the stored travel time and speed data. The goal of enhancing driver convenience is achieved by providing applications based on road traffic condition that mainly identifies congestion status. This paper presents a web application which uses live traffic congestion data from Google Maps traffic layer for real time congestion calculation. A technique utilized for estimating the level of congestion is image processing. The main objective is to provide an automated and yet interactive visualization tool for congestion analysis in real time. The aim is reducing the traffic congestion on roads which will lead to decrease in the number of accidents. It can provide important data which can help road traffic management. Thus, it is mainly dedicated to traffic managers, operators and analysts. Nevertheless it can be implemented also by road users. Unlike most sensor based applications, it makes quantified congestion data available even in regions with limited traffic data information. {\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE.},

abstract = {Road traffic injuries are the number one, non-disease-related, cause of death in the world; more than 1.2 million people die each year on the roads, and between 20 and 50 million sustain non-fatal injuries. In 2008, in the United States, there were 37 261 motor vehicle fatalities – the result of 34 017 motor vehicle crashes. Clearly, there is an urgent need for governmental agencies, and other key institutions, to increase and sustain action to prevent motor vehicle injuries. This article reports on the iterative development of SafeRoadMaps, a publicly accessible system for presenting accident frequencies and characteristics based on geographic location (www.saferoadmaps.org). The system was developed to visually communicate and allow analysis of public health issues related to rural and urban road transportation safety. One of the distinctive features of this online system is the use of ‘heat maps' as a visual means for communicating the spatial density of traffic fatalities. The article begins with a re...},

Tensor-based recommender models push the boundaries of traditional collaborative filtering techniques by taking into account a multifaceted nature of real environments, which allows to produce more accurate, situational (e.g. context-aware, criteria-driven) recommendations. Despite the promising results, tensor-based methods are poorly covered in existing recommender systems surveys. This survey aims to complement previous works and provide a comprehensive overview on the subject. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to consolidate studies from various application domains in an easily readable, digestible format, which helps to get a notion of the current state of the field.

abstract = {Public transportation systems (PTSs) play an important role in modern cities, providing shared/massive transportation services that are essential for the general public. However, due to their increasing complexity, designing effective methods to visualize and explore PTS is highly challenging. Most existing techniques employ network visualization methods and focus on showing the network topology across stops while ignoring various mobility-related factors such as riding time, transfer time, waiting time, and round-the-clock patterns. This work aims to visualize and explore passenger mobility in a PTS with a family of analytical tasks based on inputs from transportation researchers. After exploring different design alternatives, we come up with an integrated solution with three visualization modules: isochrone map view for geographical information, isotime flow map view for effective temporal information comparison and manipulation, and OD-pair journey view for detailed visual analysis of mobility factors along routes between specific origin-destination pairs. The isotime flow map linearizes a flow map into a parallel isoline representation, maximizing the visualization of mobility information along the horizontal time axis while presenting clear and smooth pathways from origin to destinations. Moreover, we devise several interactive visual query methods for users to easily explore the dynamics of PTS mobility over space and time. Lastly, we also construct a PTS mobility model from millions of real passenger trajectories, and evaluate our visualization techniques with assorted case studies with the transportation researchers.},

abstract = {When evaluating transport projects, locational accessibility measures, which connect land use and transport systems, provide insights into the potential for wider economic benefits. Emerging evidence also suggests that accessibility measures may effectively distill complex technical analyses into representations more easily understood and discussed by stakeholders with a range of expertise. A consolidated class of accessibility measures could thus potentially be the foundation for co-creative planning in which diverse stakeholders and experts work actively with transport planners to evaluate impacts of transport alternatives, especially wider impacts beyond individual travel time savings. This paper describes the development and initial testing of CoAXs (short for Collaborative Accessibility-based Stakeholder Engagement System), an open-source stakeholder engagement tool that seeks to support co-creative transport planning. Preliminary development and focus group testing using example bus rapid transit corridors in Boston, Massachusetts, suggest that interactive mapping tools can operationalize accessibility measures as a basis for engaging stakeholders in discussing the regional value and wider impacts of transport investment.},

abstract = {The visual analysis of spatiotemporal movement is a challenging task. There may be millions of routes of different length and shape with different origin and destination, extending over a long time span. Furthermore there can be various correlated attributes depending on the data domain, e.g. engine measurements for mobility data or sensor data for animal tracking. Visualizing such data tends to produce cluttered and incomprehensible images that need to be accompanied by sophisticated filtering methods. We present TrajectoryLenses, an interaction technique that extends the exploration lens metaphor to support complex filter expressions and the analysis of long time periods. Analysts might be interested only in movements that occur in a given time range, traverse a certain region, or end at a given area of interest (AOI). Our lenses can be placed on an interactive map to identify such geospatial AOIs. They can be grouped with set operations to create powerful geospatial queries. For each group of lenses, users can access aggregated data for different attributes like the number of matching movements, covered time, or vehicle performance. We demonstrate the applicability of our technique on a large, real-world dataset of electric scooter tracks spanning a 2-year period.},

Within this field, in this paper we propose an integrated solution to predict and visualize non-recurring traffic congestion in urban environments caused by Planned Special Events (PSE), such as a soccer game or a concert. Predictions are done by means of two Machine Learning-based techniques. These have been proven to successfully outperform current state of the art predictions by 35{\%} in an empirical assessment we conducted over a time frame of 7 months within the inner city of Cologne, Germany. The predicted congestions are fed into a specifically conceived visualization tool we designed to allow Decision Makers to evaluate the situation and take actions to improve mobility.},

abstract = {Managers of public transport systems have been facing for years the strategic challenge of maintaining high quality of transport services to improve the mobility of citizens, while reducing costs and ensuring safety and low environmental impact. A well-established way to evaluate the performance achieved by the system or by specific activities is to monitor Key Performance Indicators (KPI). However, existing management systems, which refer to flexible yet large and complex data models, provide a limited support to define and select relevant KPIs for the objectives at hand, and even the identification of whether and how the data model is capable to achieve a certain informative need is a critical and time-consuming task. This work is aimed to propose a framework to ease the development of a monitoring system in the public transport domain. The approach is based on the ontological representation of all the knowledge regarding indicators and their formulas, business objectives, dimension analysis and their relation with the Transmodel, the European reference data model for public transport information systems. On its top, a reasoning framework provides logic functionalities to interactively support designers in a set of common design tasks: the choice of the most suitable indicators for the performance monitoring needs at hand, the definition of new indicators and the identification of the minimal set of Transmodel modules needed to calculate them. A case study is included to discuss these applications, while an evaluation shows the feasibility of the approach.},

Through this method, large-amount taxi GPS data is processed and the spatial-temporal trajectory is analyzed. And then taxi daily operation time, operating range and residence location of individual driver, vehicle operation and rest periods and other indicators are calculated, which are important characteristic parameters of Beijing Taxi Operations. In sum, continuous, comprehensive, and dynamic analysis information for monitoring taxi operation status can be acquired through the method. These information can provide the decision basis for city taxi operation management, and help to improve the city taxi operation management level.},

abstract = {Visualization of vehicle detection (VD) data is essential because the data play an important role in traffic control and policy development. Most previous works focus on visualizing trajectories obtained from global positioning system (GPS), which are detailed but less representative. In contrast, VD data report the traffic statistic at each sensing site during a time span, including speed, flow, and occupancy of each lane, which contain comprehensive traffic information for analysis. In this work, we visualize three-year VD data of freeways in Taiwan. The visualization depicts the traffic situation at a site over time using a color-coded chart that extends from left to right over time. The charts are vertically stacked and horizontally aligned according to VD's located mileage and data time, respectively, to provide global insight. Our system allows semantic zoom, which changes the chart appearance in a continuous manner, to enable macro- and micro- scopic visualizations. Analysts can explore events that span an area with different sizes and that persist a time span with various lengths. To ensure the feasibility of our visualization, before the system design, we conducted a study with experts who work in the national freeway bureau and the institute of transportation of Taiwan. We also showed our results to the experts after the prototype system was built. The feedback shows that our VD data visualization is helpful to traffic control and policy development.

Existing techniques can reveal where/when congested areas are formed, developed, and moved on one or several highway roads, but it is still challenging to visualise the evolution of traffic congestion on the whole road network, especially on dense urban networks. To address this challenge, this paper proposes three 3D exploratory visualisation techniques: the isosurface, the constrained isosurface, and the wall map. These three techniques have different advantages and should be combined to leverage their respective strong points. We present our visualisation techniques with the case of link travel time data from Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) in London. ?? 2013 The Authors.},

Its main advantages include easy usability by passengers, improvement of the efficiency of revenue management, adequacy to integrate inter-modality approaches, easy cooperation between operators, systematic data collection and gathering tools, contributing to improve the planning process. This work starts with the literature review on applications of the Trip-Chaining Method (TCM) to the estimation of Origin-Destination (OD) matrices using entry-only AFC data. The main contribution of this study is to provide an OD matrix for the city of Porto, allowing to improve the quality of its public transport system. The paper reports the implementation of the TCM to estimate the alighting locations at the disaggregated level in the case study of Porto. The main assumptions adopted are: passengers start the next journey stage at or near the alighting location of their previous trip, passengers end the last trip of the day at the boarding location of the first trip of the day, passengers can only alight in the sequence of stops not yet traveled by the route / direction they boarded, passengers have a maximum interchange distance, above which the destination of that journey stage is not inferred.},

This paper investigates the application of SOM in the representation and prediction of multi-dimensional traffic time series. First, SOMs are applied to cluster the time series and to project each multi-dimensional vector onto a two-dimensional SOM plane while preserving the topological relationships of the original data. Then, the easy visualization of the SOMs is utilized and several exploratory methods are used to investigate the physical meaning of the clusters as well as how the traffic flow vectors evolve with time. Finally, the k-nearest neighbor (kNN) algorithm is applied to the clustering result to perform short-term predictions of the traffic flow vectors. Analysis of real world traffic data shows the effectiveness of these methods for traffic flow predictions, for they can capture the nonlinear information of traffic flows data and predict traffic flows on multiple links simultaneously.},

abstract = {This research examines whether individual exposures to traffic congestion are significantly different between assessments obtained with and without considering individuals' activity-travel patterns in addition to commuting trips. We used crowdsourced real-time traffic congestion data and the activity-travel data of 250 individuals in Los Angeles to compare these two assessments of individual exposures to traffic congestion. The results revealed that individual exposures to traffic congestion are significantly underestimated when their activity-travel patterns are ignored, which has been postulated as a manifestation of the uncertain geographic context problem (UGCoP). The results also highlighted that the probability distribution function of exposures is heavily skewed but tends to converge to its average when individuals' activity-travel patterns are considered when compared to one obtained when those patterns are not considered, which indicates the existence of the neighborhood effect averaging problem (NEAP). Lastly, space-time visualizations of individual exposures illustrated that people's exposures to traffic congestion vary significantly even if they live at the same residential location due to their idiosyncratic activity-travel patterns. The results corroborate the claims in previous studies that using data aggregated over areas (e.g., census tracts) or focusing only on commuting trips (and thus ignoring individuals' activity-travel patterns) may lead to erroneous assessments of individual exposures to traffic congestion or other environmental influences.},

abstract = {Rapid urbanization is placing increasing stress on already burdened transportation infrastructure. Ubiquitous mobile computing and the massive data it generates presents new opportunities to measure the demand for this infrastructure, diagnose problems, and plan for the future. However, before these benefits can be realized, methods and models must be updated to integrate these new data sources into existing urban and transportation planning frameworks for estimating travel demand and infrastructure usage. While recent work has made great progress extracting valid and useful measurements from new data resources, few present end-to-end solutions that transform and integrate raw, massive data into estimates of travel demand and infrastructure performance. Here we present a flexible, modular, and computationally efficient software system to fill this gap. Our system estimates multiple aspects of travel demand using call detail records (CDRs) from mobile phones in conjunction with open- and crowdsourced geospatial data, census records, and surveys. We bring together numerous existing and new algorithms to generate representative origin-destination matrices, route trips through road networks constructed using open and crowd-sourced data repositories, and perform analytics on the system's output. We also present an online, interactive visualization platform to communicate these results to researchers, policy makers, and the public. We demonstrate the flexibility of this system by performing analyses on multiple cities around the globe. We hope this work will serve as unified and comprehensive guide to integrating new big data resources into customary transportation demand modeling.},

abstract = {Planners have a long history of using Geographic Information Systems, simulation models and three-dimensional (3D) visualizations in research and practice projects. Although some have successfully integrated GIS and simulation modeling or GIS and computer visualization, few have met the challenge of integrating the three technologies into one system in order to support planning and decision-making. In an effort toward reaching this goal, a prototype traffic impact analysis system has been developed. Automobile traffic and travel speed are predicted with a volume/capacity ratio model. Carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations along roadways are calculated using the US Environmental Protection Agency's CAL3QHC model. GIS is used to prepare data and execute the models and present the modeling results in a geographic context. A series of 3D models of street segments and buildings along the highway are developed and subsequently integrated with simulation results to allow a geo-referenced 3D presentation, including animations of driving experiences. This study documents the benefits and challenges of integrating the technologies.},

abstract = {The traffic infrastructure greatly impacts the quality of life in urban environments. To optimize this infrastructure, engineers and decision makers need to explore traffic data. In doing so, they face two important challenges: the sparseness of speed sensors that cover only a limited number of road segments, and the complexity of traffic patterns they need to analyze. In this paper we take a first step at addressing these challenges. We use New York City (NYC) taxi trips as sensors to capture traffic information. While taxis provide substantial coverage of the city, the data captured about taxi trips contain neither the location of taxis at frequent intervals nor their routes. We propose an efficient traffic model to derive speed and direction information from these data, and show that it provides reliable estimates. Using these estimates, we define a time-varying vector-valued function on a directed graph representing the road network, and adapt techniques used for vector fields to visualize the traffic dynamics. We demonstrate the utility of our technique in several case studies that reveal interesting mobility patterns in NYC's traffic. These patterns were validated by experts from NYC's Department of Transportation and the NYC Taxi {\&} Limousine Commission, who also provided interesting insights into these results.},

abstract = {The progressive trend of urbanization involving changes in the activities of a city has created several problems. Addressing these problems requires reliable and detailed information regarding the urban structure and its dynamics. Previous studies have tried to explore cellular networks data for urban analysis, yet little attention has been given in exploring mobility related events of cellular networks. This study uses handover, which is the process of transferring an ongoing call from one cell to the other, to capture urban dynamics. The handover data was collected from cellular towers in Lisbon, Portugal. First, our method started with a pre-processing of the handover data. Then, experiments were carried out to understand the city dynamics through GIS visualization and statistical analysis. The visualizations provided a qualitative explanation of how the movement of calls is useful in highlighting the flow of people in urban infrastructures. Using statistical analysis, two important relationships were proved: there is a significant association between cell towers with a high number of incoming handovers and a high presence of people in their vicinity; and a greater proximity to the main road links of cell towers characterized by a high number of incoming as well as outgoing handovers thus towers denoting more movement. Our results suggest that the handover information, taking the advantage of its pervasiveness, can provide ways to analyze city dynamics at a larger scale. This approach complements the effort of traditional urban data collection methods, which are usually made available less frequently to urban planners and policy makers. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The application of Information Visualization methods provides new ways of analyzing geospatial data. Exploring and analyzing the vast volumes of data has become increasingly difficult. Information visualization and visual data mining can help to deal with this flood of information. Visualization techniques have been developed over the last two decades to support the exploration of large data sets. Visual data exploration usually follows a three-step process: overview first, zoom and filter, and then details-on-demand. The advantage of visual data exploration is that the user is directly involved in the data mining process. Visualization technology may be used for all three steps of the data exploration process. Visualization techniques are useful for showing an overview of visualization and allowing the user to identify interesting subsets. In this step, it is important to keep the overview visualization while focusing on the subset using another visualization technique. An alternative is to distort the overview visualization to focus on the interesting subsets. This can be performed by dedicating a larger percentage of the display to the interesting subsets while decreasing screen utilization for uninteresting data.},

In reviewed applications, visualization has been used primarily for communicating information on the geometric design, or as photorealistic representations that place trasportation projects within their existing or envisioned built or natural context. A review of examples of transportation visualization also indicates that visualization methods are mostly application specific. This paper focuses on the use of visualization during the construction process of highway projects to facilitate collaborative decision-making on construction scheduling and traffic planning. For the visualization of construction scheduling and traffic planning a 4D technology that makes use of a comprehensive 3D project database is proposed. The same 3D database can be also used for the development of photo-realistic animations that can facilitate the dissemination of traffic measures information to the traveling public during construction. This approach has been used during the construction of a section of a large-scale highway interchange project in Dallas, Texas.},

Handling these micro-scale spaces within the broader context of outdoor - urban environments is a significant challenge in transportation analysis and geographic information science. This complexity stems from the greater computational requirements, the specificity of indoor network data structures, as well as the inherent perceptual intricacies of 3D visualization. As built environments grow in size and in complexity, two-dimensional urban geography research reveals its limits. This paper advocates for 3D network-based urban research and showcases the feasibility of this approach for three specific types of urban analytical functionalities, namely route planning, spatial accessibility assessment, and facility location planning. The latter modeling functionality can be viewed as foundational elements for comprehensive network-based three-dimensional analytics of urban environments. The effectiveness of the data modeling scheme and of the integrated software application 3DCityNet is discussed through the three coupled geospatial modeling functionalities. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

These graphs form a high-level description of a traffic jam and its propagation in time and space. Our system provides multiple views for visually exploring and analyzing the traffic condition of a large city as a whole, on the level of propagation graphs, and on road segment level.

More than 88 million movements between pairs of radio cells—so-called handovers—served as a proxy for more than two months of mobility within four urban test areas in Northern Italy. In contrast to previous work, our approach relies entirely on visualization and mapping techniques, implemented in several software applications. We purposefully avoid statistical or probabilistic modeling and, nonetheless, reveal characteristic and exceptional mobility patterns. The results show, for example, surprising similarities and symmetries amongst the total mobility and people flows between the test areas. Moreover, the exceptional patterns detected can be associated to real-world events such as soccer matches. We conclude that the visual analytics approach presented can shed new light on large-scale collective urban mobility behavior and thus helps to better understand the “pulse” of dynamic urban systems.},

abstract = {The paper presents City Flow, an urban traffic visualization prototype based on real post streams captured from Sina Weibo, the most popular social networking site in China. With the increasingly pervasive use of online social networks in China, these new channels attract more users than conventional social media. People use them to seek comments and points exchanges about urgent event and popular news. However, the high noise level precludes conscious or objective standpoints. Especially regarding urban traffic, the challenge is to synthesize some general characteristics of cities rather than to follow a particular event. City Flow captures a mass of data from the conversations about traffic issues through Sina Weibo and generates visualizations of general patterns in addition to including detailed insights. This paper describes the interface design, interaction modes, and data capturing methods. It also presents initial feedback from a usability study and observational findings in terms of the cities' characteristics. Our design considerations present both an overall sentiment and detailed perspectives. We define a hierarchy of categories including City Sentiment, Related Topics, and Time-based Posts Stream based on factors such as topic variables and time-span dynamics. This organizational strategy is intended to guide viewers away from the noise and towards a closer examination of facts. Online social networks add a new dimension of offering views at an individual level rather than authority level when considering social issues. But this contributes to a new phenomenon of people paying excessive attention to their personal views. Our intention is to explore ways to guide people from a micro view towards a macro view in looking into online conversations. Through the prototype of City Flow we experiment and explore the methods of designing for both collective sentiment and individual attitudes on traffic conversations. The main goal is to inspire people to refle- t on the general representations and to form opinions by considering individuals' perspectives.},

The records of the bus smart card data are more than 38 million a month, and can represent the travel behavior of people. In this study, system of the bus smart card data collection in Japan is introduced, and the enormous bus smart card data is visualized for grasping the current transportation situation in the area of interest. In order to establish application of the bus smart card data to transportation planning, plausible analysis methods with the detailed travel behavior of people acquired by the bus smart card data are developed. For utilization of the bus smart card data, a method of converting bus smart card data to travel time and bus trip data is developed. The converted empirical data is applied to origin-destination analysis, and average of bus travel time estimation. By using the average bus travel time, relationship between the travel time and traffic congestion are analyzed. Additionally, an integration method of the bus smart card data with probe data is investigated. The integrated empirical data is applied to traffic monitoring, and extraction of obstructive factor for traffic flow.},

@article{Psyllidis2016,
abstract = {The study of dynamic spatial and social phenomena in cities has evolved rapidly in the recent years, yielding new insights into urban dynamics. This evolution is strongly related to the emergence of new sources of data for cities (e.g. sensors, mobile phones, online social media etc.), which have potential to capture dimensions of social and geographic systems that are difficult to detect in traditional urban data (e.g. census data). However, as the available sources increase in number, the produced datasets increase in diversity. Besides heterogeneity, emerging social urban data are also characterized by multidimensionality. The latter means that the information they contain may simultaneously address spatial, social, temporal, and topical attributes of people and places. Therefore, integration and geospatial (statistical) analysis of multidimensional data remain a challenge. The question which, then, arises is how to integrate heterogeneous and multidimensional social urban data into the analysis of human activity dynamics in cities? To address the above challenge, this thesis proposes the design of a framework of novel methods and tools for the integration, visualization, and exploratory analysis of large-scale and heterogeneous social urban data to facilitate the understanding of urban dynamics. The research focuses particularly on the spatiotemporal dynamics of human activity in cities, as inferred from different sources of social urban data. The main objective is to provide new means to enable the incorporation of heterogeneous social urban data into city analytics, and to explore the influence of emerging data sources on the understanding of cities and their dynamics. In mitigating the various heterogeneities, a methodology for the transformation of heterogeneous data for cities into multidimensional linked urban data is, therefore, designed. The methodology follows an ontology-based data integration approach and accommodates a variety of semantic (web) and linked data technologies. A use case of data interlinkage is used as a demonstrator of the proposed methodology. The use case employs nine real-world large-scale spatiotemporal data sets from three public transportation organizations, covering the entire public transport network of the city of Athens, Greece. To further encourage the consumption of linked urban data by planners and policy-makers, a set of webbased tools for the visual representation of ontologies and linked data is designed and developed. The tools – comprising the OSMoSys framework – provide graphical user interfaces for the visual representation, browsing, and interactive exploration of both ontologies and linked urban data. After introducing methods and tools for data integration, visual exploration of linked urban data, and derivation of various attributes of people and places from different social urban data, it is examined how they can all be combined into a single platform. To achieve this, a novel web-based system (coined SocialGlass) for the visualization and exploratory analysis of human activity dynamics is designed. The system combines data from various geo-enabled social media (i.e. Twitter, Instagram, Sina Weibo) and LBSNs (i.e. Foursquare), sensor networks (i.e. GPS trackers, Wi-Fi cameras), and conventional socioeconomic urban records, but also has the potential to employ custom datasets from other sources. A real-world case study is used as a demonstrator of the capacities of the proposed web-based system in the study of urban dynamics. The case study explores the potential impact of a city-scale event (i.e. the Amsterdam Light festival 2015) on the activity and movement patterns of different social categories (i.e. residents, non-residents, foreign tourists), as compared to their daily and hourly routines in the periods before and after the event. The aim of the case study is twofold. First, to assess the potential and limitations of the proposed system and, second, to investigate how different sources of social urban data could influence the understanding of urban dynamics. The contribution of this doctoral thesis is the design and development of a framework of novel methods and tools that enables the fusion of heterogeneous multidimensional data for cities. The framework could foster planners, researchers, and policy makers to capitalize on the new possibilities given by emerging social urban data. Having a deep understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics of cities and, especially of the activity and movement behavior of people, is expected to play a crucial role in addressing the challenges of rapid urbanization. Overall, the framework proposed by this research has potential to open avenues of quantitative explorations of urban dynamics, contributing to the development of a new science of cities.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a visual analysis system to explore sparse traffic trajectory data recorded by transportation cells. Such data contains the movements of nearly all moving vehicles on the major roads of a city. Therefore it is very suitable for macro-traffic analysis. However, the vehicle movements are recorded only when they pass through the cells. The exact tracks between two consecutive cells are unknown. To deal with such uncertainties, we first design a local animation, showing the vehicle movements only in the vicinity of cells. Besides, we ignore the micro-behaviors of individual vehicles, and focus on the macro-traffic patterns. We apply existing trajectory aggregation techniques to the dataset, studying cell status pattern and inter-cell flow pattern. Beyond that, we propose to study the correlation between these two patterns with dynamic graph visualization techniques. It allows us to check how traffic congestion on one cell is correlated with traffic flows on neighbouring links, and with route selection in its neighbourhood. Case studies show the effectiveness of our system.},

Ridership and adherence are the two main dimensions for evaluating the quality of service. Using Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL), Automatic Passenger Count (APC), and Global Positioning System (GPS) data, ridership data and adherence data of public transportation can be collected. In this paper, we discuss the development of a visualization tool for exploring public transportation data. We introduce "map view" and "route view" to help users locate stops in the context of geography and route information. To visualize ridership and adherence information over several years, we introduce "calendar view" - a miniaturized calendar that provides an overview of data where users can interactively select specific days to explore individual trips and stops ("trip subview" and "stop subview"). MetroViz was evaluated via a series of usability tests that included researchers from the Center for Advanced Transportation Technology (CATT) and students from the University of Maryland - College Park in which test participants used the tool to explore three years of bus transit data from Blacksburg, Virginia.},

abstract = {The operational performance of public transport networks is an important aspect of urban planning and development. Despite the network focus of services and delays which are often focused spatially, little research has examined the spatial pattern of operational performance of urban public transport. This paper explores the operational performance of on-road public transport using spatial and historical analysis at a network wide level. Operational performance is investigated through analysis of stop level Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) data and utilizes visualization techniques in geographical information systems (GISs) to explore spatial and temporal patterns of change. The network in question is the Melbourne tram (streetcar) network, which has a large historical dataset of AVL data since 2001 providing information on scheduled arrival times, actual arrival times, times of departure, and more. Statistical analysis is undertaken to determine average travel times and the standard deviation of travel times. The statistical analysis is then imported into a GIS package for further analysis; the Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) methodology is used to explore spatial variations in data. Outputs include observation of travel times across the network, a reliability analysis investigating actual vs. scheduled travel times and coefficients of variation, and trend analyses to observe the change in tram travel time and change in coefficient of variation. Through this analysis, various changes in travel time and reliability were observed between 2001 and 2010. Vast areas saw improvements in travel time and reliability, while some areas were identified to have deteriorated performance. This paper identifies that the spatial representation of large datasets is of great value in an ongoing monitoring of the network and a powerful reporting tool on a network level basis. Moreover, the results identify transit issues for the Melbourne tram network planners for further investigation.},

abstract = {Using GIS to evaluate travel behaviour is an important technique to increase our understanding of the relationship between accessibility and transport demand. In this paper, the activity space concept was used to identify the nature of participation in activities (or lack of it) amongst a group of students using a 2day travel–activity diary. Three different indicators such as the number of unique locations visited, average daily distance travelled, and average daily activity duration were used to measure the size of activity spaces. These indicators reflect levels of accessibility, personal mobility, and the extent of participation, respectively. Multiple regression analyses were used to assess the impacts of students socio-economic status and the spatial characteristics of home location. Although no differences were found in the levels of accessibility and the extent of participation measures, home location with respect to a demand responsive transport (DRT) service was found to be the most important determinant of their mobility patterns. Despite being able to travel longer distances, students who live outside of the DRT service area were found to be temporally excluded from some opportunities. Student activity spaces were also visualised within a GIS environment and a spatial analysis was conducted to underpin the evaluation of the performance of the DRT. This approach was also used to identify the activity spaces of individuals that are geographically excluded from the service. Evaluation of these results indicated that although the service currently covers areas of high demand, 90{\%} of the activity spaces remained un-served by the DRT service. Using this data six new routes were designed to meet the coverage goal of public transport based on a measure of network impedance based on inverse activity density. Following assessment of public transport service coverage, the study was extended using a spatial multi criteria evaluation (SMCE) technique to assess the effect of service provision on patronage.},

@article{Ahmed2007a,
abstract = {Transportation systems exist within at least two types of space. One is the apparent geographic space, but equally important is the time–space implied by the travel time relations created by the system. Differences between the geographic and time–spaces are properties induced by the transportation system. Methods for time–space transformations of geographic space to explore, visualize and analyze transportation systems were initially developed in the 1960s and 1970s. However, these methods have not been pursued beyond this initial flurry of research activity, most likely due to the difficulties associated with handling and processing digital geographic data. The rise of geographic information systems (GIS), as well as continued development and wider availability of transformation techniques such as multidimensional scaling (MDS) and spatial analytical techniques such as bidimensional regression can allow the potential of time–space transformation techniques to be realized. This paper presents a general methodological framework that exploits recent advances in GIS, MDS and spatial analytical techniques. Results from applying these techniques to the Salt Lake City metropolitan area illustrate the power of these techniques to reveal spatial patterns in the travel time relationships induced by a transportation system. The application also addresses fundamental issues in time–space transformations, such as two-dimensional versus three-dimensional solutions, Euclidean versus non-Euclidean solutions and symmetric and asymmetric solutions.},

We report our experience in building the Visual Analytics for Intelligent Transportation (VAIT) system, which is the first system on real-life large-scale data sets for intelligent transportation. Our key observation is that metropolitan transportation data are inherently visual as they are spatio-temporal around road networks. Therefore, we visualize and manage traffic data, together with digital maps, and support analytical queries through this interactive visual interface. As a case study, we demonstrate VAIT on real-world taxi GPS and meter data sets from 15 000 taxis running for two months in a Chinese city of over 10 million people. We discuss the technical challenges in data calibration, storage, visualization, and query processing and offer first-hand lessons learned from developing the system. Based on our extensive empirical experiment results, VAIT beats state-of-the-art methods and systems in terms of scalability, efficiency, and effectiveness and offers us an easy-to-use, efficient, and scalable platform to shed more light on intelligent transportation research. {\textcopyright} 2000-2011 IEEE.},

abstract = {As increasing volumes of urban data are captured and become available, new opportunities arise for data-driven analysis that can lead to improvements in the lives of citizens through evidence-based decision making and policies. In this paper, we focus on a particularly important urban data set: taxi trips. Taxis are valuable sensors and information associated with taxi trips can provide unprecedented insight into many different aspects of city life, from economic activity and human behavior to mobility patterns. But analyzing these data presents many challenges. The data are complex, containing geographical and temporal components in addition to multiple variables associated with each trip. Consequently, it is hard to specify exploratory queries and to perform comparative analyses (e.g., compare different regions over time). This problem is compounded due to the size of the data-there are on average 500,000 taxi trips each day in NYC. We propose a new model that allows users to visually query taxi trips. Besides standard analytics queries, the model supports origin-destination queries that enable the study of mobility across the city. We show that this model is able to express a wide range of spatio-temporal queries, and it is also flexible in that not only can queries be composed but also different aggregations and visual representations can be applied, allowing users to explore and compare results. We have built a scalable system that implements this model which supports interactive response times; makes use of an adaptive level-of-detail rendering strategy to generate clutter-free visualization for large results; and shows hidden details to the users in a summary through the use of overlay heat maps. We present a series of case studies motivated by traffic engineers and economists that show how our model and system enable domain experts to perform tasks that were previously unattainable for them.},

The combination of both matrices reveals that differences in travel time during peak and off-peak hours are high for intra-city commuting and low for inter-city commuting.},

Although various models have been used to estimate their emissions, it has been difficult to effectively apply these estimation models due to the need for user-friendly interfaces, the large amounts of underlying data, and the potential data inaccuracy. In this paper, we present a web-based support system developed for transit operators who need to estimate and visualize the emissions of diesel transit buses where a micro-scale Vehicle Specific Power approach is used to estimate emissions based on global positioning system data. Case studies show that the web-based support system provides a user-friendly environment that makes it easier to apply emission estimation methodologies and visualize emissions.},

abstract = {A new methodology is developed to discover and analyze the hidden knowledge of massive taxi trajectory data within a city. This approach creatively transforms the geographic coordinates (i.e. latitude and longitude) to street names reflecting contextual semantic information. Consequently, the movement of each taxi is studied as a document consisting of the taxi traversed street names, which enables semantic analysis of massive taxi data sets as document corpora. Hidden themes, namely taxi topics, are identified through textual topic modeling techniques. The taxi topics reflect urban mobility patterns and trends, which are displayed and analyzed through a visual analytics system. The system integrates interactive visualization tools, including taxi topic maps, topic routes, street clouds and parallel coordinates, to visualize the probability-based topical information. Urban planners, administration, travelers, and drivers can conduct their various knowledge discovery tasks with direct semantic and visual assists. The effectiveness of this approach is illustrated by case studies using a large taxi trajectory data set acquired from 21, 360 taxis in a city.},

Here, we report the major developments of the GO resource during the past two years. Each monthly release of the GO resource is now packaged and given a unique identifier (DOI), enabling GO-based analyses on a specific release to be reproduced in the future. The molecular function ontology has been refactored to better represent the overall activities of gene products, with a focus on transcription regulator activities. Quality assurance efforts have been ramped up to address potentially out-of-date or inaccurate annotations. New evidence codes for high-throughput experiments now enable users to filter out annotations obtained from these sources. GO-CAM, a new framework for representing gene function that is more expressive than standard GO annotations, has been released, and users can now explore the growing repository of these models. We also provide the 'GO ribbon' widget for visualizing GO annotations to a gene; the widget can be easily embedded in any web page.},

abstract = {Current geographical information systems (GIS) are not well adapted to the management of very dynamic geographical phenomena. This is due to the lack of conceptual and physical interoperability with real-time computing facilities. The research described in this paper is oriented towards the identification and experimentation of a new methodological and applied framework for the real-time integration, manipulation and visualisation of urban traffic data. It is based on proactive interaction between the spatio-temporal database and visualisation levels, and between the visualisation and end-user levels. The proposed framework integrates different spatial and temporal levels of granularity during the analysis of urban traffic data. Urban traffic behaviours are analysed either by observation of the movements of several vehicles in space, or by changes in urban network properties (i.e., micro- versus macro-modelling). Visualisation and interaction tools together constitute a flexible interface environment for the visualisation of urban traffic data within GIS. These concepts provide a relevant support for the visual analysis of urban traffic patterns in the thematic, spatial and temporal dimensions. This integrated framework is illustrated by an experimental prototype developed in a large town in the UK.},

abstract = {Social media data with geotags can be used to track people's movements in their daily lives. By providing both rich text and movement information, visual analysis on social media data can be both interesting and challenging. In contrast to traditional movement data, the sparseness and irregularity of social media data increase the difficulty of extracting movement patterns. To facilitate the understanding of people's movements, we present an interactive visual analytics system to support the exploration of sparsely sampled trajectory data from social media. We propose a heuristic model to reduce the uncertainty caused by the nature of social media data. In the proposed system, users can filter and select reliable data from each derived movement category, based on the guidance of uncertainty model and interactive selection tools. By iteratively analyzing filtered movements, users can explore the semantics of movements, including the transportation methods, frequent visiting sequences and keyword descriptions. We provide two cases to demonstrate how our system can help users to explore the movement patterns.},
